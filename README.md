### Contributing

I really love these colors, and seeing others appreciate and use it makes all the effort worthwhile.
Creating Yorumi has been a labor of love for me. If Yorumi speaks to you and you're keen to see it ported for your favorite application, 
you might just be best-suited to make it happen. Here’s how you might lend a hand:
1. **Create a Theme**: Grab our color palette and craft a new theme. You can find great documentation on our [website](https://yorumicolors.cc/docs).
It's not just about spreading Yorumi—it's about refining your own design and development skills, and making your digital life more seamless.
3. **Share Your Work**: Content with what you've made? We'd be happy to take a look! Create a pull request, with the URL to your repository in the body.
If it is accepted, we'd like to have the repo moved into this organization, and you'll be given full rights to administer it.
